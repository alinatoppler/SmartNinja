## Exercise 1.1

Ask user to tell you what mood s/he is in:

- if the mood is "happy", the program should print out "It is great to see you happy!"
- if the mood is "nervous", respond with "Take a deep breath 3 times.". Use elif to enter more if statements: elif mood == "nervous":.
- Make up responses also for "sad", "excited" and "relaxed".
- The last option should be the normal else, which responds with "I don't recognize this mood".

## Exercise 1.2

A game called Guess the secret number.
Your task is to create this game:

First "hard-code" some number in the program (write the number into a variable). You can call this variable secret.
Then the user has to find out what this number is (using input()). Store user's guess in a variable called guess.
Check if your secret is equal to user's guess.
If the user's guess is wrong, let him/her know that (use print() and if/else).
If the user's guess is correct, congratulate him/her.

## Exercise 1.3

Write a program that does the basic arithmetic operations:

addition (+),
subtraction (-),
multiplication (*),
and division (/).
Ask the user to enter two numbers and the arithemtic operation ("+", "-", "*" or "/").

Then use if/elif/else statements to do the right operation. A hint:
if operation == "+":
