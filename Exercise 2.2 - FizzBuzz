#Exercise 2.2: FizzBuzz
#User enters a number between 1 and 100
#FizzBuzz program starts to count to that number (it prints them in the Terminal).
#n case the number is divisible with 3, it prints "fizz" instead of the number.
# #If the number is divisible with 5, it prints "buzz"
#If it's divisible with both 3 and 5, it prints "fizzbuzz"


print("Hi there, welcome to the fizzbuzz game. Please select a number between 1 and 100")

number=input("number: ")
number=int(number)  #converts strings into numbers

range_low=1
range_high=100

for num in range(int(number)):
        if num%3==0 and num%5==0:
            print("fizzbuzz")
        elif num%3==0:
            print("fizz")
        elif num%5 == 0:
            print("buzz")
        else:
            print(num)
